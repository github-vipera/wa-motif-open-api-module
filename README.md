# wa-motif-open-api-module
This project contains the **@wa-motif-open-api** modules and a kitchen-sink project to test the various components.

Each API module implements the client side of Motif's Rest API.

The division of the API follows that of the MOTIF services; thus, for example, the PlatformService APIs are contained in the `@wa-motif-open-api/platform-service` library and those of the SecurityService in the `@wa-motif-open-api/security-service` library, etc...

All libraries are generated through the **Angular CLI**, the **SWAGGER Codegen** tool and the API definition **Yaml files**.



## How to create a new API library

In this section we will explain the steps to create a new API library for a given MOTIF service.

### Prerequisite

In order to create a new library you need to install the Angular CLI:

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

if you want to know more about Angular CLI you can find here: https://cli.angular.io/

We also advise you to read the following tutorial: https://blog.angularindepth.com/creating-a-library-in-angular-6-87799552e7e5

### Create the Library Project

The first thing to do is to create a new library project. To do this, just go to the root of this project and enter the Angular CLI command in a terminal session:

```bash
ng generate library @wa-motif-open-api/my-new-service
```

where "my-new-service" is the name of the new service that you are going to create.
After this you can see a new project folder called `my-new-service` under the `/projects` folder.

Now you will have to remove all the files contained in the `src/lib` folder of your created library project.

### Generate Typescript API and Models

To generate the source code to use in the new service, we will use the SWAGGER Codegen tool. 
In this project you can find the `swagger_generator` folder with the necessary tool **swagger-codegen-cli.jar**.

To generate the new sources of the desired service you must first get the YAML file defining the REST API.
So you have to run the following command at the terminal:

```bash
java -jar ./swagger_generator/swagger-codegen-cli.jar generate -i ./path_to_file/MyNewService.yaml -l typescript-angular -o ./swagger_generator/output/sources  
```

The tool will generate all the sources in the folder `./swagger_generator/output/sources`.
**Note**: before launching the above command, you must ensure that the folder `./swagger_generator/output/sources` is empty or nonexistent.

A set of source files like these will be generated:

`api.module.ts`

`configuration.ts`

`encoder.ts`

`index.ts`

`variables.ts`

`api/...`

`model/...`

Now you have to copy all these files into the `src/lib` folder of the new library project you created earlier.
Now change the contents of the src / public_api.ts file of your library project in this way:

 `export * from './lib/index';`

## Modify the sources

Motify the `src/lib/api.module.ts` file of the new library project you created earlier to have a meaningful service name.

Under the `src/lib/api` folder you will find all the self-generated services. You'll most likely need to correct these services by adding braces '}' to close the methods where necessary. This is due to a current bug of the codegen tool.

You can check if all the changes are ok trying to run a build as follows:

```bash
ng build @wa-motif-open-api/my-new-service
```

For each method created for each autogenerated service you must also check that the "body" parameter is correctly passed to the call on the HttpClient.

For example, if you see a API call signature like this:

    

```typescript
public createUser(domain: string, body?: UserCreate, observe: any = 'body', reportProgress: boolean = false ): Observable<any>
```

 you must ensure that the "body" parameter (in this case of the USerCreate type) is correctly passed in the call (see at line 3 the `body` variable):

```typescript
this.httpClient.post(`${this.basePath}/platform/domains/${encodeURIComponent(String(domain))}/users`,
  body,
  {
    withCredentials: this.configuration.withCredentials,
    headers: headers,
    observe: observe,
    reportProgress: reportProgress
   }
 );
```

This is due to another current bug of the codegen tool.

### Paged Queries

If there are some in your API that can be paged, you must manually add support for this.
To do this you must change the signature of the method that calls them and add a piece of code as in the following example:

```typescript
import { MotifPagedQuery, MotifQueryResults, MOTIF_PAGED_QUERY_PARAM } from 'web-console-core' 
```

*the import directive*



```typescript
    public getUsersList(domain: string, observe: any = 'body', reportProgress: boolean = false, pagedQuery:MotifPagedQuery): Observable<any> 
```

*the new signature with a new param for `MoifPagedQuery`*



and add the code into the method body:

```typescript
let params = null;
if (pagedQuery){
   params = new HttpParams()
      .set(MOTIF_PAGED_QUERY_PARAM, JSON.stringify(pagedQuery))
   observe = 'response';
}

.....

return this.httpClient.get(`${this.basePath}/platform/domains/${encodeURIComponent(String(domain))}/users`,
  {
    withCredentials: this.configuration.withCredentials,
    headers: headers,
    observe: observe,
    reportProgress: reportProgress,
    params: params
  } 
);
```



## How To Test your API Project

Like all the other Angular standard tests, the tests of your new services will be based on [Jasmine test Framework](https://jasmine.github.io/).

Because all APIs need authentication before being invoked, you may find this helper class that can be invoked in your tests useful for logging in automatically:

```typescript
import { Injectable }                      		from '@angular/core';
import { HttpClient }                           from '@angular/common/http';
import { MotifConnectorService, AuthService } 	from 'web-console-core'
import { Observable} 							from "rxjs";


@Injectable()
export class MotifCommunicatoriTestHelper {

    public motifConnector:MotifConnectorService;
    public authService:AuthService;

    constructor(private http:HttpClient){
        this.motifConnector = new MotifConnectorService(http);
        this.authService = new AuthService(http, 'http://your_motif_test_environment:8080', null, null);
    }

    public login(userName:string, password:string):Observable<any>{
        return this.authService.login({userName:userName, password:password});
    }
    
}
```

To create the tests of your services you will need to create a typescrypt spec.ts file for each of them.

You will need to initialize the Web Console system so that you can perform some basic operations (such as authentication):

```typescript
describe('UsersService', () => {
    let motifCommunicatoriTestHelper:MotifCommunicatoriTestHelper;
    
    beforeEach(() => {
        TestBed.configureTestingModule({ 
            providers: [ 
                { provide: HTTP_INTERCEPTORS, useClass: AuthService, multi: true },
                { provide :WebConsoleConfig, useValue: new WebConsoleConfig('','') }
            ],
            imports: [ HttpClientModule ]
        });
    });

    afterEach(() => {
    });

    
    it(`should issue a users list request`,
        // 1. declare as async test since the HttpClient works with Observables
        async(
            inject([HttpClient], (http: HttpClient) => {
                // 1. inject HttpClient into the test
                this.motifCommunicatoriTestHelper = new MotifCommunicatoriTestHelper(http);

                // 2. perform the authentication
                this.motifCommunicatoriTestHelper.login("admin","admin").subscribe(value=>{
                    
                    // 3. send the request to test
                    let userService = new UsersService(this.motifCommunicatoriTestHelper.http, TEST_BASE_PATH, new Configuration());
                    userService.getUsersList('Default').subscribe(value=>{
                        expect(value.length).toBe(16);
                    },error=>{
                        console.log("getUsersList Error", error);
                    })
                    
                }, error=>{
                    console.log("Authentication error", error);
                })
                
            })  

        )
    );

    it(`should issue a user info`,
        // 1. declare as async test since the HttpClient works with Observables
        async(
            inject([HttpClient], (http: HttpClient) => {
                // 1. inject HttpClient into the test
                this.motifCommunicatoriTestHelper = new MotifCommunicatoriTestHelper(http);

                // 2. perform the authentication
                this.motifCommunicatoriTestHelper.login("admin","admin").subscribe(value=>{
                    
                    // 3. send the request to test
                    let userService = new UsersService(this.motifCommunicatoriTestHelper.http, TEST_BASE_PATH, new Configuration());
                    userService.getUser('Default','admin').subscribe(value=>{
                        expect(value.userId).toEqual('admin')
                    },error=>{
                        console.log("getUsersList Error", error);
                    })
                }, error=>{
                    console.log("Authentication error", error);
                })
                
            })  
        )
    );

});

```

As you can see in the `beforeEach` call, the Web Console components needed to run this test are added.

The service that you intend to test can be instantiated directly in your test case.

For a complete reference on Angular tests we refer you to the official guide you can find here: [Angular Testing](https://angular.io/guide/testing).

## How to document your API Project 

To create the automatic documentation of your API project you can use the [Compodoc tool](https://compodoc.app).

Documentation is created using a script node that you must configure within the package.json file of your API library:

`"compodoc": "../../../node_modules/.bin/compodoc -p ./tsconfig.lib.json"`

For example:

```json
{
  "name": "@wa-motif-open-api/platform-service",
  "version": "0.0.3",
  "scripts": {
    "compodoc": "../../../node_modules/.bin/compodoc -p ./tsconfig.lib.json"
  },
  "peerDependencies": {
    "@angular/common": "^6.0.0-rc.0 || ^6.0.0",
    "@angular/core": "^6.0.0-rc.0 || ^6.0.0",
    "web-console-core": "^0.0.13"
  },
  "dependencies": {}
}
```

*library project package.json*

After you have correctly configured the script inside package.json you can go to the root of your API library project and run in the terminal:

`npm run compodoc`

At the end of the process, a folder called Documentation will be created in the same folder, containing the entire Compodoc site regarding your project
